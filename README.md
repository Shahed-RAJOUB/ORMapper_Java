# ORMapper
## SWE3_Project to design an OR Mapper

## Used laguages:
* Java
* Postgres

## Functionality:
* A Good ORM cam lead to much less code and much less repetition in a project
* Allows the changes in Database technologies
* Queries should be generated by the mapper without even thinking about Dialect or how the transaction is happening.
* This Design is simplified to approach a simple application of OR Mapper using Java, Postgress Container in Docker
* Database tables are already present and the Mapper enables the queries on these tables
* The mapper is designed Code first style following these steps:
  * Configuring the connection with the Database as settings in presistence layer
  * Adding the classes as tables and the properties as columns in Entity layer
  * Adding different functions 'Select, delete, insert, update, drop' in Services layer
  * Adding transactions services 'join, find' in Service layer
  * Model layer is used to show a demo of the ORMapper and uses annotations 
  * Annotations layer to define the reflection function that will define the tables and the columns
